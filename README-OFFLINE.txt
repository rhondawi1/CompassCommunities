Compass Communities &ndash; Offline Bundle (v42)
=========================================

This site is fully self-contained. It runs entirely from local files with no external
assets required (no CDNs, no fonts, no scripts from the web).

How to open:
1) Unzip this folder anywhere (e.g., Desktop).
2) Double-click `index.html`.
3) Navigate via the header/footer links. All pages and images are inside this folder.

Notes:
- Some buttons intentionally link **out** to public websites (e.g., Nichols & Wood, JBLC Construction,
  Affordable Housing Oregon). Those are regular outbound links and will open in your browser if
  you are online; otherwise they simply won&rsquo;t load (the local site still works).
- The Events page stores attachment links in your browser&rsquo;s localStorage so it works offline.
- You can replace `hero.jpg` with your own photo; keep the same filename.

Files included (key pages):
- index.html &mdash; Home
- projects.html &mdash; Project directory (filters + detail via hash routes)
- apply.html &mdash; Apply page (demo form)
- bids.html &mdash; RFP portal (table-only)
- register.html &mdash; Contractor registration form (redirects to success)
- register-success.html &mdash; Confirmation handoff
- events.html &mdash; Upcoming & Past events with attachable links
- partner.html &mdash; Municipal Partnerships
